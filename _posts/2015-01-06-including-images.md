so since we can't do style yet (A says to "master" formatting first)--it is very hard to not jump the gun--i've been given an assignment: to embed an image from another site. 

not just an image. a gif!

okay..finally found info about images in the jekyll page on writing posts

it says you need to make a folder called assets or downloads. 

base assumption is that you would need to find a file then save it into the folder structure

so the thing says this as a sample: \!\[My helpful screenshot\]\(\{\{ site.url \}\}/assets/screenshot.jpg\)

testing: [Shiba-Ram!]({{site.url}}/assets/shibaram.jpg)

update: boo it doesn't work locally...is it because the IMAGE NEEDS TO BE COMMITTED??

committed shibaram.jpg and pushed it...now trying code again..

testing: [Shiba-Ram!]({{site.url}}/assets/shibaram.jpg)

update: doesn't work.. :( back to the drawing board..
