It's hard to catch up! WHYYY 

OK: luckily I am remembering that today I can do a recap post now that I'm 10 days in.

MAIN TAKEAWAY: IT'S HARD TO POST EVERYDAY! Major props to those who blog so frequently and keep fresh content served. How do you do it?!?

I've decided that this difficulty boils down to two things: 

1. Finding time--not only to come up with what to do, then learn it, and write about it (which would be obvious), but primarily the problem lies in finding time at all after work and other commitments. 

2. Finguring out what to do. The last 10 days have been used to focus on the content structuring/formatting that is part of jekyll. Looks like I'm reaching the bottom of the barrel--I realize I still haven't quite figured out pagination, but for the most part, the blog format of the blog is up and running! and I know how to make a new page and a new post. 

So, what's next? A says style, so style it is. I'll keep looking into pagination and then how to host images instead of just display them, but off to look into changing colors! To do that, the next stretch of time will be spent looking into CSS. 

Wish me luck!
