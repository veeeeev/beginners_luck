okay I'll be honest: did not write this on the 9th, instead the morning of the 10th :( jeez blogging every day is hard! for the sake of beautiful continuity I'm forging the date of this post, and this is my confession that this is a make-up post. 

Back to pagination! 

The Jekyll site says that they have pagination built-in, so we can automatically generate the right files and folders required for paginated listings.

aha! Looking straight at the big blue banner that I formerly ignored..."Pagination only works within HTML Files!" 

aaaaawwwwwwwwwwwwww
