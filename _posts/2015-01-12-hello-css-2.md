opening the main.scss folder

scss and sass convert into css but A says to go straight in and just do css

jekyll documenation talks about how to get sass and scss into the fold as assets but i guess i'll be looking online for how to change the current file?

K told me about https://www.bento.io/ which I guess compiles different pieces of MOOC curriculum and pieces it together into tracks for people? it's a cute layout. 

Anyway, so I guess I'll try out the codeacademy offering for html and css for starters and see where that takes me...
