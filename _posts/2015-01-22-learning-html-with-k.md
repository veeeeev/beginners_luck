html is like a human: it has a head and a body.

or like a sandwich because you need an opening tag and a closing tag

the head has stuff like the title or links to refer to the directory that holds a style sheet to be used in the html

things in the head is the set up for the body--that said you can also put things that are in the head in the body also

the body is things that people will see on the page

every tag is telling the computer what needs to be there and how to refer to it, like a map with a key. the computer uses the key (css) to identify the parts on the map (the page)

page is a map full of little symbols, and you use css or javascript to define what the symbols are

common tags:

"div" introduces partitions to make sections of your page so you can style groups of things. div tags create a block. you can style the sections by adding id = or class = and putting a unique identifier that helps you refer to definitions from your css

"p" starts a new paragraph

"h1" is a header (as the number gets higher the font gets smaller)

everything else just look it up.
