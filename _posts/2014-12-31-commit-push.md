so, apparently all of these posts have not been made public yet. to do that, first you have to commit it and push it live to an actual site.

scary. to the actual interwebs. i sound like such a noob.

A (my wonderful programmer partner) walked me through how versioning and commits work on sourcetree...then we broke down the versions and denoted each commit..then pushed it live! it was confusing at first since it didn't actually go live, but after some troubleshooting apparently it takes 30 min for github to actually make it LIVE live. and now it's up!
