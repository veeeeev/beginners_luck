it is hard to make sure you do something every day! back to work tomorrow after the holidays and looking forward to some big changes..more on that at a later date. just spent the last two hours working on decks and wrapping things up to go back to the grind, so trying to get a small exercise in before sleeping!

picking up on yesterday's permalink practice, going to make two new pages and cross link between them. How about just [test 1]({{site.baseurl}}/test1) and [test 2]({{site.baseurl}}/test2). off to make new page files...

haha you see what I did there? :) ok saved new page files and inserted cross-linking links that point at each other..with added bonus point practice linking to those new test pages from this post...

to commit...fingers crossed!
