BLOCKQUOTES using >

SYMBOLS for bullets need a space after the symbol and white space to separate
+ A
+ B
+ C
* D
* E 
* F

INDENTATION helps with formatting lists
1. blahblah
	blahblahblah
2. eifjekfjekfj

HYPERLINKS

[text](URL "optional title for when hovering") 

sample: [My Project] (https://vivianschan.github.io/beginners_luck "Beginner's Luck")

Alternatively, reference links:
[Text] [any number to use as reference]

then anywhere else in the file you can denote either [Text]: URL "Name" OR [ref number]: URL "Name"

sample: [Beginner's Luck][1]
[1]: https://vivianschan.github.io/beginners_luck "Beginner's Luck"
