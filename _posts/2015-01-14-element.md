busy. ahh..

okay how do i learn a little piece of html for tonight with the little time left before sleeping for the commute tomorrow morning?

on codeacademy and will do how to learn module 1

and ended up with a small lesson from A instead! 

So, html concepts to know for CSS are tags and divs

elements are the whole line, made up of an opening tag and a closing tag

< > bahbalhbajb </ > 

common tag is div, which is significant because it doesn't do anything

divs can be assigned CLASS (in css it's a .) and ID (in css it's a #)

class don't have to be unique, but id's are unique

style is everything that transforms content. you have divs in html with the style set with css on the right hand once you remove a style sheet on a website. not in chrome, but in firefox. 

mulling time...
