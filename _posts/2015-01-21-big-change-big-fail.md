i know, i know, it's been 5 days of silence. goodbye resolution completion.

i have an excuse! well not really an excuse but more of an explanation.

two things happened of note that threw me off entirely:

first, i left my job. AHGSDKLFJKEF yes. it's been a very crazy few weeks so far in the new year--2 weeks of saying goodbyes to everyone i knew from the last 2.5 years..and now 2 weeks of funemployment, or so i thought..

until, second thing happened: the same evening of my last day at work--HOURS before i was supposed to leave on a weeklong roadtrip to actually do something with my time off between jobs while my sister K is in town..A and i were walking home and i sprained my ankle. WALKING! 

#"#fail" 

so the last 5 days have been spent trying to get back on my feet--crutches look fun but they're really not. you'd think icing and elevating the foot would be a perfect time to open up the laptop and learn some css, but it's been exhausting! 

to pick back up on where i left off though: next step is to learn css. since K is still home, i'm trying to spend my days with her, and she's promised i can learn css in 15 minutes--so let's see how that goes tomorrow. :)
