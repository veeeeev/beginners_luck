This is a test

##Hello World##

#This is my first time using a terminal, markdown, textmate, and github all in one go. #

Well it's December 31 again folks, we all know what that means. Another year has flown by somehow and tomorrow is another day..year..yes.

well that sucks, the formatting of this is all wrong. poking around the quickstart guide on jekyll and all the associated documentation (aka collective, well-intended, organized jargon to help people use it)..doesn't really work. A set up the install and config for me on the magic black box--"terminal"--and downloaded TextMate as a text editor for me (all words I am just picking up now) and pulled up a few sites to try out Markdown (which is a "markup"???). We had set me up on Github back in September when I had my initial fleeting desire to try out blogging (again, which clearly failed since I haven't touched any of this until today). 
He is cooking lunch as I try to poke around and figure out how all these things pair up together. I have managed to create some new files, go into the Finder and create a new folder, but this post refuses to post.

update: THE EAGLE HAS LANDED. THIS POST IS POSTED! Apparently one MUST save the post file with all DASHES (-) and .md in order to publish properly, else it will not show up.
Still will not format correctly even though I tried out the text in http://dillinger.io/ and it looks fine there..UGH

update: FORMATTING FIXED. after lunch--carbonara a la America's Test Kitchen--A pointed out that in markdown you need white space (aka an extra line between lines) to create disparate paragraphs. The ### still works. Now why couldn't the guide have said that? The laypeople of the world need a coding for dummies guide! In the internet's defense I have not yet gone through to look for every single tutorial and go through it. Maybe this project can be my own documentary of learning to do this stuff from zero--or more accurately, negative.
