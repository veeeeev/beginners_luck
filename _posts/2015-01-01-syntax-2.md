Well that was embarassing...GAH

What went wrong..hmm..off to dillinger.io to test things out in markdown before putting this to production. T_T

--

update: went to dillinger. WTH it seems to look find in the markdown editor...

--

update: notes inline. apparently Sublime shows you a pink block for erroneous coding like spaces where there shouldn't be any..

BLOCKQUOTES using > (Forgot to add the white space for the next paragraph to break the > line from this paragraph)

> # What's the worst case?

> > this is a nested blockquote

SYMBOLS for bullets need a space after the symbol and white space to separate

+ A
+ B
+ C
* D
* E 
* F

INDENTATION helps with formatting lists

1. blahblah
	blahblahblah
2. eifjekfjekfj

HYPERLINKS < apparently...you can't have spaces between the parentheses and brackets for links... 

"[text](URL "optional title for when hovering")"

sample: "[My Project](https://vivianschan.github.io/beginners_luck "Beginner's Luck")""

result: [My Project](https://vivianschan.github.io/beginners_luck "Beginner's Luck")

Alternatively, reference links:

"[Text][any number to use as reference]"

looks like [Text][any number to use as reference]

then anywhere else in the file you can denote either [Text]: URL "Name" OR [ref number]: URL "Name"

sample: [Beginner's Luck][1]

[1]: https://vivianschan.github.io/beginners_luck "Beginner's Luck"

EMPHASIS < apparently in order to do type out the code piece without it being processed, you need \ per character that would otherwise have code, to "escape" the code functionality... weird. 

> \*single asterisks\*
> 
> \_single underscores\_
> 
> \*\*double asterisks\*\*
> 
> \_\_double underscores\_\_

will produce:

> *single asterisks*
> 
> _single underscores_
> 
> **double asterisks**
> 
> __double underscores__
