Well that was embarassing...GAH

What went wrong..hmm..off to dillinger.io to test things out in markdown before putting this to production. T_T

--
update: went to dillinger. WTH it seems to look find in the markdown editor...

--
update: apparently...you can't have spaces between the parentheses and brackets for links... AND putting things in " " will allow you to have it show up as is, rather than automatically converting to code. AND apparently Sublime shows you a pink block for erroneous coding like spaces where there shouldn't be any..

BLOCKQUOTES using > (Forgot to add the white space for the next paragraph)

> # What's the worst case?

> > this is a nested blockquote

SYMBOLS for bullets need a space after the symbol and white space to separate

+ A
+ B
+ C
* D
* E 
* F

INDENTATION helps with formatting lists

1. blahblah
	blahblahblah
2. eifjekfjekfj

HYPERLINKS

"[text](URL "optional title for when hovering")"

sample: "[My Project](https://vivianschan.github.io/beginners_luck "Beginner's Luck")""

result: [My Project](https://vivianschan.github.io/beginners_luck "Beginner's Luck")

Alternatively, reference links:

"[Text][any number to use as reference]"

looks like [Text][any number to use as reference]

then anywhere else in the file you can denote either [Text]: URL "Name" OR [ref number]: URL "Name"

sample: [Beginner's Luck][1]

[1]: https://vivianschan.github.io/beginners_luck "Beginner's Luck"
