html is not format sensitive, as in all tags can be in a line. but format within tags is format sensitive. 

it's like describing something to a blind person 

if you don't have a tag then you don't get to see it

people only care about what's in between the tags

here is the basic exercise i was barked through at:

```
<!DOCTYPE html>

<!-- this is a comment -->

<head><title>hello</title></head>

<body><p><h1>hello world</h1></p></body>

</html> 

<a> = link tag DO NEED CLOSING TAGS 
<img> = image tags do not need closing tags

inside a and img tags is "href=" and you put either a URL (pointer to location in quotes) or a file within your directory (it has to be in quotes! i.e. "<img href="XYZ.jpg">)

sample <a href="LINK.com"> HIGHLIGHTED THING YOU CLICK </a>
```

REMEMBER: inside all the tags you can use id/class in addition to href to style them

note to self: DO NOT FORGET THE LOAVES bottom loaf specifically, esp the html loaf.
