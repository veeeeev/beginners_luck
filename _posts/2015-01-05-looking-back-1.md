New things on the horizon...today was a big day for me. I told my closest friends at work that I was leaving the company. Lots of bittersweet feelings, a bit of sad, a bit of fear, a lot of excitement, and tension trying to reel it all. Business as usual for 2 weeks while I wrap things up, which means lots of decks and the long hard commute both ways, which has never been harder to wake up for nor sit through after a long day. 

There is no rest for the wicked. 

Today is Day 5...it's hard..to make time for these little things, as little as they are. 

A says I should get a pass so I'll start using every 5th day as a reflection post to look back on what I've done so far and plan out what to do the next 5 days.

So, I was at negative/zero New Year's Eve when I started this whole thing. Got set up, got my first exposure to the tools, the script, the general look and feel. I LOL'd at markdown being a markup language. When we first set me up on Github (only to put it down for 3 months), A told me to look at Jekyll documentation since we'd identified that it might be a good small digestible project to take on. Yeah, right. I looked at it...opened up my signature browser full of tabs...then closed them. 

Now we're at day 5. The last few days have been spent 1. figuring out how to document my progress and create posts/pages 2. committing as often as possible <--I like the versioning/change log nature 3. practiced markdown using tools online 4. got a crash course about origin vs local and rebasing 5. worked with permalinks which took a long time for me to wrap my head around what the actionable takeaway was for the actual site, but then got the hang of it. 

Next, I want to try customization of the template, even if just a little. Let's say arbitrarily (I reserve the right to change the direction of this next "sprint" ha) color changing. 

Good night--waking up this morning was so hard, tomorrow will only be harder. I cannot wait for daylight savings so we can wake up with it being light out again. AGH
