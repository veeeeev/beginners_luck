okay

so far to get off the ground with creating some basic blog posts on a basic site, you need some tools--this is me struggling through the basics on a Mac:

* (aha! learned from daring fireball that you make bulleted lists in markdown with * or - or numbers..*NOTE you need a space between the bullet symbol and your first word!) 

* GitHub

* terminal: I am using iTerm

* text editor: I am using TextMate 2.0 beta

* finder to have the directory in folder form

* online resources: since I am using http://daringfireball.net/projects/markdown/syntax to help me use markdown and http://dillinger.io/ for practice

* if you're lucky enough, an attentive partner who cooks and can help you with the basics without taking over and doing it all for you
