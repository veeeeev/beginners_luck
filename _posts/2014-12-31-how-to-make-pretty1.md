ok, so the blog posts and formatting seems to be working...how do we make this a little prettier?

update: guessing that you go to _layouts > _post and open that up...

A says that format/prettiness is "style" which is apparently separate from content, which is what i've been able to mess with via texteditor. 

great. plain it is for now..
