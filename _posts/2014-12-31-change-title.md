apparently the title lives in _config.yml

also i picked up on the daring fireball site that you do blockquotes with this symbol: > so here goes..

Update: Once you make your changes in the config file, you save. but it doesn't show up when you refresh the local host! apparently you have to go back to the terminal and hit "ctrl+C" then the "up" arrow so that "jekyll serve" shows up and you hit enter--i guess refreshing the whole site backend since you messed with config..then you hit refresh on your localhost and it works! 

hello world, i'm vivian and i have no idea what i'm doing..and am trying to change that, slowly.
